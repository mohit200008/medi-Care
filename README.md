With the rise of people getting affected with Covid-19, we were looking into the data on the level of healthcare people all around India was receiving, one of the things we found that people in rural areas are clueless about the symptoms of the disease. They also lack proper medical supervision/care.

Hence, we came up with the idea of providing the people all over the world a web application that will not only connect the those in need with the correct medical care/supervision but also enable them to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way.
